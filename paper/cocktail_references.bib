abstract = {Marine viruses are an important component of the microbial food web, influencing microbial diversity and contributing to bacterial mortality rates. Resistance to cooccurring cyanophages has been reported for natural communities of Synechococcus spp.; however, little is known about the nature of this resistance. This study examined the patterns of infectivity among cyanophage isolates and unicellular marine cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.). We selected for phage-resistant Synechococcus mutants, examined the mechanisms of phage resistance, and determined the extent of cross-resistance to other phages. Four strains of Synechococcus spp. (WH7803, WH8018, WH8012, and WH8101) and 32 previously isolated cyanomyophages were used to select for phage resistance. Phage-resistant Synechococcus mutants were recovered from 50 of the 101 susceptible phage-host pairs, and 23 of these strains were further characterized. Adsorption kinetic assays indicate that resistance is likely due to changes in host receptor sites that limit viral attachment. Our results also suggest that receptor mutations conferring this resistance are diverse. Nevertheless, selection for resistance to one phage frequently resulted in cross-resistance to other phages. On average, phage-resistant Synechococcus strains became resistant to eight other cyanophages; however, there was no significant correlation between the genetic similarity of the phages (based on g20 sequences) and cross-resistance. Likewise, host Synechococcus DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (rpoC1) genotypes could not be used to predict sensitivities to phages. The potential for the rapid evolution of multiple phage resistance may influence the population dynamics and diversity of both Synechococcus and cyanophages in marine waters.},

abstract = {Many bacterial species produce capsular polysaccharides that contribute to pathogenesis through evasion of the host innate immune system. The gram-positive pathogen Enterococcus faecalis was previously reported to produce one of four capsule serotypes (A, B, C, or D). Previous studies describing the four capsule serotypes of E. faecalis were based on immunodetection methods; however, the underlying genetics of capsule production did not fully support these findings. Previously, it was shown that capsule production for serotype C (Maekawa type 2) was dependent on the presence of nine open reading frames (cpsC to cpsK). Using a novel genetic system, we demonstrated that seven of the nine genes in the cps operon are essential for capsule production, indicating that serotypes A and B do not make a capsular polysaccharide. In support of this observation, we showed that serotype C and D capsule polysaccharides mask lipoteichoic acid from detection by agglutinating antibodies. Furthermore, we determined that the genetic basis for the difference in antigenicity between serotypes C and D is the presence of cpsF in serotype C strains. High-pH anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection analysis of serotype C and D capsules indicated that cpsF is responsible for glucosylation of serotype C capsular polysaccharide in E. faecalis.},

abstract = {We previously identified a gene cluster, epa (for enterocococcal polysaccharide antigen), involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis of Enterococcus faecalis and showed that disruption of epaB and epaE resulted in attenuation in translocation, biofilm formation, resistance to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) killing, and virulence in a mouse peritonitis model. Using five additional mutant disruptions in the 26-kb region between orfde2 and OG1RF{\_}0163, we defined the epa locus as the area from epaA to epaR. Disruption of epaA, epaM, and epaN, like prior disruption of epaB and epaE, resulted in alteration in Epa polysaccharide content, more round cells versus oval cells with OG1RF, decreased biofilm formation, attenuation in a mouse peritonitis model, and resistance to lysis by the phage NPV-1 (known to lyse OG1RF), while mutants disrupted in orfde2 and OG1RF{\_}163 (the epa locus flanking genes) behaved like OG1RF in those assays. Analysis of the purified Epa polysaccharide from OG1RF revealed the presence of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, GalNAc, and GlcNAc in this polysaccharide, while carbohydrate preparation from the epaB mutant did not contain rhamnose, suggesting that one or more of the glycosyl transferases encoded by the epaBCD operon are necessary to transfer rhamnose to the polysaccharide. In conclusion, the epa genes, uniformly present in E. faecalis strains and involved in biosynthesis of polysaccharide in OG1RF, are also important for OG1RF shape determination, biofilm formation, and NPV-1 replication/lysis, as well as for E. faecalis virulence in a mouse peritonitis model.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a thera-peutic bacteriophage preparation (Biophage-PA) targeting antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic otitis. Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial approved by UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees (COREC) ethical review process. Setting: A single specialist university hospital. Participants: 24 patients with chronic otitis with a dura-tion of several years (2–58). Each patient had, at the time of entry to the trial, an ear infection because of an antibi-otic-resistant P. aeruginosa strain sensitive to one or more of the six phages present in Biophage-PA. Participants were randomised in two groups of 12 treated with either a single dose of Biophage-PA or placebo and followed up at 7, 21 and 42 days after treatment by the same otolo-gist. Ears were thoroughly cleaned on each occasion and clinical and microbiological indicators measured. Main outcome measures: Physician assessed erythema ⁄ inflammation, ulceration ⁄ granulation ⁄ polyps, discharge quantity, discharge type and odour using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients reported discom-fort, itchiness, wetness and smell also using a VAS. Bacterial levels of P. aeruginosa and phage counts from swabs were measured initially and at follow-up. At each visit patients were asked about side effects using a structured form. Digital otoscopic images were obtained on days 0 and 42 for illustrative purposes only. Results: Relative to day 0, pooled patient-and physi-cian-reported clinical indicators improved for the phage treated group relative to the placebo group. Variation from baseline levels was statistically significant for combined data from all clinic days only for the phage treated group. Variation from baseline levels was statistically significant for the majority of the patient assessed clinical indicators only for the phage treated group. P. aeruginosa counts were significantly lower only in the phage treated group. No treatment related adverse event was reported. Conclusion: The first controlled clinical trial of a therapeutic bacteriophage preparation showed efficacy and safety in chronic otitis because of chemo-resistant P. aeruginosa. Chronic otitis is a common and difficult-to-treat condi-tion. The major pathogens responsible are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. 1,2 In particular P. aeruginosa infections has proven very hard to eradicate as the bacterium organises itself in a 'biofilm' where it can be protected both from antibiotics and immune cells.},

abstract = {Interactions between bacteria and the viruses that infect them (i.e., phages) have profound effects on biological processes, but despite their importance, little is known on the general structure of infection and resistance between most phages and bacteria. For example, are bacteria-phage communities characterized by complex patterns of overlapping exploitation networks, do they conform to a more ordered general pattern across all communities, or are they idiosyncratic and hard to predict from one ecosystem to the next? To answer these questions, we collect and present a detailed metaanalysis of 38 laboratory-verified studies of host-phage interactions representing almost 12,000 distinct experimental infection assays across a broad spectrum of taxa, habitat, and mode of selection. In so doing, we present evidence that currently available host-phage infection networks are statistically different from random networks and that they possess a characteristic nested structure. This nested structure is typified by the finding that hard to infect bacteria are infected by generalist phages (and not specialist phages) and that easy to infect bacteria are infected by generalist and specialist phages. Moreover, we find that currently available host-phage infection networks do not typically possess a modular structure. We explore possible underlying mechanisms and significance of the observed nested host-phage interaction structure. In addition, given that most of the available host-phage infection networks examined here are composed of taxa separated by short phylogenetic distances, we propose that the lack of modularity is a scale-dependent effect, and then, we describe experimental studies to test whether modular patterns exist at macroevolutionary scales.},

abstract = {Background Bacteriophages specific for Yersinia pestis are routinely used for plague diagnostics and could be an alternative to antibiotics in case of drug-resistant plague. A major concern of bacteriophage therapy is the emergence of phage-resistant mutants. The use of phage cocktails can overcome this problem but only if the phages exploit different receptors. Some phage-resistant mutants lose virulence and therefore should not complicate bacteriophage therapy.   Methodology/Principal Findings The purpose of this work was to identify Y. pestis phage receptors using site-directed mutagenesis and trans-complementation and to determine potential attenuation of phage-resistant mutants for mice. Six receptors for eight phages were found in different parts of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inner and outer core. The receptor for R phage was localized beyond the LPS core. Most spontaneous and defined phage-resistant mutants of Y. pestis were attenuated, showing increase in LD50 and time to death. The loss of different LPS core biosynthesis enzymes resulted in the reduction of Y. pestis virulence and there was a correlation between the degree of core truncation and the impact on virulence. The yrbH and waaA mutants completely lost their virulence.   Conclusions/Significance We identified Y. pestis receptors for eight bacteriophages. Nine phages together use at least seven different Y. pestis receptors that makes some of them promising for formulation of plague therapeutic cocktails. Most phage-resistant Y. pestis mutants become attenuated and thus should not pose a serious problem for bacteriophage therapy of plague. LPS is a critical virulence factor of Y. pestis.},

abstract = {Background Bacteriophage could be an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy against multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, the emergence of resistant variants after phage treatment limited its therapeutic application.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, an approach, named “Step-by-Step” (SBS), has been established. This method takes advantage of the occurrence of phage-resistant bacteria variants and ensures that phages lytic for wild-type strain and its phage-resistant variants are selected. A phage cocktail lytic for Klebsiella pneumoniae was established by the SBS method. This phage cocktail consisted of three phages (GH-K1, GH-K2 and GH-K3) which have different but overlapping host strains. Several phage-resistant variants of Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated after different phages treatments. The virulence of these variants was much weaker [minimal lethal doses (MLD){\textgreater}1.3×109 cfu/mouse] than that of wild-type K7 countpart (MLD = 2.5×103 cfu/mouse). Compared with any single phage, the phage cocktail significantly reduced the mutation frequency of Klebsiella pneumoniae and effectively rescued Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in a murine K7 strain challenge model. The minimal protective dose (MPD) of the phage cocktail which was sufficient to protect bacteremic mice from lethal K7 infection was only 3.0×104 pfu, significantly smaller (p{\textless}0.01) than that of single monophage. Moreover, a delayed administration of this phage cocktail was still effective in protection against K7 challenge.   Conclusions/Significance Our data showed that the phage cocktail was more effective in reducing bacterial mutation frequency and in the rescue of murine bacteremia than monophage suggesting that phage cocktail established by SBS method has great therapeutic potential for multidrug-resistant bacteria infection.},

abstract = {During the past few decades, enterococci have emerged as important healthcare-associated pathogens (Arias {\&} Murray, 2012; Austin, Bonten, Weinstein, Slaughter, {\&} Anderson, 1999; Boyce, et al., 1994; Benenson, et al., 2009; Goossens, 1998; Handwerger, et al., 1993). The continuing progress of modern medical care toward more intensive and invasive medical therapies for human disease has undoubtedly contributed to the increased prevalence of these remarkable opportunistic pathogens. This trend has also been attributed to the increasing antibiotic resistance among clinical isolates of enterococci. The rapid spread of enterococci with resistance to vancomycin (VRE) has been of particular concern. Many healthcare-associated strains that are resistant to vancomycin also show resistance to penicillin, as well as high-level resistance (HLR) to aminoglycosides. Finally, as has historically been the case with enterococci, resistance is emerging to newer agents used to treat VRE infections, such as linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and daptomycin (Chow, Donahedian, {\&} Zervos, 1997; Herrero, Issa, {\&} Patel, 2002; Sabol, Patterson, Lewis II, Aaron, Cadena, {\&} Jorgensen, 2005). Over the past two decades, Enterococcus faecium has emerged as a leading cause of multidrug-resistant enterococcal infection in the United States (Hidron, et al., 2008). E. faecium is intrinsically more antibiotic-resistant than E. faecalis, with more than half of its pathogenic isolates expressing resistance to vancomycin, ampicillin, and high-levels of aminoglycosides. Treating infections caused by this species can be difficult, and the magnitude of the problem is vast. Approximately 40{\%} of medical intensive care units in a recent National Healthcare Safety Network report found that the majority of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary drainage catheters, and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (80{\%} and 90.4{\%}, respectively) (Hidron, et al., 2008). Although they were often resistant to high-level aminoglycosides and some macrolides, healthcare-associated infections in these units due to E. faecalis remained largely susceptible to vancomycin and ampicillin (93.1{\%} and 96.2{\%}, respectively) for reasons that are not entirely known. Other enterococcal species are rarer causes of human infection, including E. durans, E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E. hirae, E. gallinarum, E. raffinosus, and E. muntdii (Gordon, et al., 1992). In the following sections, the common human infections caused by enterococci are briefly described. The epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant enterococci in healthcare settings is summarized, including the role of colonization pressure and host factors on the emergence of VRE in clinical settings. Finally, the current challenges facing clinicians who treat antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are reviewed.},

abstract = {Increasing prevalence and severity of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections has necessitated novel antibacterial strategies. Ideally, new approaches would target bacterial pathogens while exerting selection for reduced pathogenesis when these bacteria inevitably evolve resistance to therapeutic intervention. As an example of such a management strategy, we isolated a lytic bacteriophage, OMKO1, (family Myoviridae) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that utilizes the outer membrane porin M (OprM) of the multidrug efflux systems MexAB and MexXY as a receptor-binding site. Results show that phage selection produces an evolutionary trade-off in MDR P. aeruginosa, whereby the evolution of bacterial resistance to phage attack changes the efflux pump mechanism, causing increased sensitivity to drugs from several antibiotic classes. Although modern phage therapy is still in its infancy, we conclude that phages, such as OMKO1, represent a new approach to phage therapy where bacteriophages exert selection for MDR bacteria to become increasingly sensitive to traditional antibiotics. This approach, using phages as targeted antibacterials, could extend the lifetime of our current antibiotics and potentially reduce the incidence of antibiotic resistant infections.},

Recurrent infections related to multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in hospitals are untreatable and question the effectiveness of notable drugs. Two major reasons for these recurrent infections are acquired antibiotic resistance genes and biofilm formation. None of the traditionally known effective techniques have been able to efficiently resolve these issues. Hence, development of a highly effective antibacterial practice has become inevitable. One example of a hard-to-eradicate pathogen in dentistry is Enterococcus faecalis, which is one of the most common threats observed in recurrent root canal treatment failures, of which the most problematic to treat are its biofilm-forming VRE strains.

Despite multiple antibiotic courses and efforts at percutaneous drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst, the patient deteriorated over a four-month period. In the absence of effective antibiotics, two laboratories identified nine different bacteriophages with lytic activity for an A. baumannii isolate from the patient. Administration of these bacteriophages intravenously and percutaneously into the abscess cavities was associated with reversal of the patient's downward clinical trajectory, clearance of the A. baumannii infection, and a return to health. The outcome of this case suggests that the methods described here for the production of bacteriophage therapeutics could be applied to similar cases and that more concerted efforts to investigate the use of therapeutic bacteriophages for MDR bacterial infections are warranted.},

abstract = {Phage therapy has regained interest in recent years due to the alarming spread of antibiotic resistance. Whilst phage cocktails are commonly sold in pharmacies in countries such as Georgia and Russia, this is not the case in western countries due to western regulatory agencies requiring a thorough characterization of the drug. Here, DNA sequencing of constituent biological entities constitutes a first step. The pyophage (PYO) cocktail is one of the main commercial products of the Georgian Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology and is used to cure skin infections. Since its first production in the 1930s, the composition of the cocktail has been periodically modified to add phages effective against emerging pathogenic strains. In this paper, we compared the composition of three PYO cocktails from 1997 (PYO97), 2000 (PYO2000) and 2014 (PYO2014). Based on next generation sequencing, de novo assembly and binning of contigs into draft genomes based on tetranucleotide distance, thirty and twenty-nine phage draft genomes were predicted in PYO97 and PYO2014, respectively. Of these, thirteen and fifteen shared high similarity to known phages. Eleven draft genomes were found to be common in the two cocktails. One of these showed no similarity to publicly available phage genomes. Representatives of phages targeting E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. coli, Proteus, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were found in both cocktails. Finally, we estimated larger overlap of the PYO2000 cocktail to PYO97 compared to PYO2014. Using next generation sequencing and metagenomics analysis, we were able to characterize and compare the content of PYO cocktails separated by 17 years in time. Even though the cocktail composition is upgraded every six months, we found it to remain relatively stable over the years.},

Because of the high frequency of antibiotic resistance among Enterococcus clinical isolates, interest in using phage to treat enterococcal infections and to decolonize high-risk patients for antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus is rising. Bacteria can evolve phage resistance, but there is little published information on these mechanisms in E. faecalis In this report, we identified genetic determinants of E. faecalis resistance to $\phi$NPV1. We found that loss-of-function mutations in epaR confer $\phi$NPV1 resistance by blocking phage adsorption. We attribute the inability of the phage to adsorb to the modification or loss of an extracellular polymer in strains with inactivated epaR. Phage-resistant epaR mutants exhibited increased daptomycin and osmotic stress susceptibilities. Our results demonstrate that in vitro spontaneous resistance to $\phi$NPV1 comes at a cost in E. faecalis OG1RF.},

In a previous paper, we isolated phage EFDG1, highly effective against both planktonic and biofilm cultures of one of the most challenging pathogenic species, the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Thus, it is a promising phage to be used in phage therapy. Further experimentation revealed the emergence of a mutant resistant to EFDG1 phage: EFDG1r. A disastrous occurrence in the development of antibiotic resistance, it proved only a minor hindrance in phage development. We quickly and successfully isolated a new phage, EFLK1, which proved effective against both the resistant mutant EFDG1r and its parental VRE, E. faecalis V583. Furthermore, combining both phages in a cocktail produced an additive effect against E. faecalis V583 strains regardless of their antibiotic or phage-resistance profile. An analysis of the differences in genome sequence, genes, mutations and tRNA content of both phages is presented. This work is a proof-of-concept of one of the most significant advantages of phage therapy, namely the ability to easily overcome emerging resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {Phages shape the structure of natural bacterial communities and can be effective therapeutic agents. Bacterial resistance to phage infection, however, limits the usefulness of phage therapies and could destabilise community structures, especially if individual resistance mutations provide cross-resistance against multiple phages. We currently understand very little about the evolution of cross-resistance in bacteria–phage interactions. Here we show that the network structure of cross-resistance among spontaneous resistance mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolved against each of 27 phages is highly modular. The cross-resistance network contained both symmetric (reciprocal) and asymmetric (nonreciprocal) cross-resistance, forming two cross-resistance modules defined by high within- but low between-module cross-resistance. Mutations conferring cross-resistance within modules targeted either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis, suggesting that the modularity of cross-resistance was structured by distinct phage receptors. In contrast, between-module cross-resistance was provided by mutations affecting the alternative sigma factor, RpoN, which controls many lifestyle-associated functions, including motility, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing. Broader cross-resistance range was not associated with higher fitness costs or weaker resistance against the focal phage used to select resistance. However, mutations in rpoN, providing between-module cross-resistance, were associated with higher fitness costs than mutations associated with within-module cross-resistance, i.e., in genes encoding either lipopolysaccharide or type IV pilus biosynthesis. The observed structure of cross-resistance predicted both the frequency of resistance mutations and the ability of phage combinations to suppress bacterial growth. These findings suggest that the evolution of cross-resistance is common, is likely to play an important role in the dynamic structure of bacteria–phage communities, and could inform the design principles for phage therapy treatments.},

abstract = {Enterococcus faecalis is a human intestinal pathobiont with intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics, including vancomycin. Nature provides a diverse and virtually untapped repertoire of bacterial viruses, or bacteriophages (phages), that could be harnessed to combat multi-drug resistant enterococcal infections. Bacterial phage resistance represents a potential barrier to the implementation of phage therapy, emphasizing the importance of investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of phage resistance. Using a cohort of 19 environmental lytic phages with tropism against E. faecalis , we found that these phages require the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (Epa) for productive infection. Epa is a surface-exposed heteroglycan synthesized by enzymes encoded by both conserved and strain specific genes. We discovered that exposure to phage selective pressure favors mutation in non-conserved epa genes both in culture and in a mouse model of intestinal colonization. Despite gaining phage resistance, epa mutant strains exhibited a loss of resistance to the cell wall targeting antibiotics, vancomycin and daptomycin. Finally, we show that an E. faecalis epa mutant strain is deficient in intestinal colonization, cannot expand its population upon antibiotic-driven intestinal dysbiosis and fails to be efficiently transmitted to juvenile mice following birth. This study demonstrates that phage therapy could be used in combination with antibiotics to target enterococci within a dysbiotic microbiota. Enterococci that evade phage therapy by developing resistance may be less fit at colonizing the intestine and sensitized to vancomycin preventing their overgrowth during antibiotic treatment.},
